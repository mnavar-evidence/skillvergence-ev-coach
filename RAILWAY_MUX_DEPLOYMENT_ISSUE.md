# Railway Mux Deployment Issue

## Problem
The Railway backend deployment is not picking up our muxPlaybackId changes despite multiple commits and pushes to the main branch.

## Current API Response
```bash
curl "https://api.mindsherpa.ai/api/courses/course-1" | jq '.videos[0]'
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "id": "1-1",
  "title": "1.1 EV Safety Pyramid - Who's Allowed to Touch",
  "videoUrl": "https://youtu.be/4KiaE9KPu1g",
  "muxPlaybackId": null,  // ❌ Should be "MPYRvK9KnXqBafit01UdxV023S011gYphUUavHkJKu96Z8"
  "youtubeVideoId": "4KiaE9KPu1g"
}
```

## Expected API Response
```json
{
  "id": "1-1",
  "title": "1.1 EV Safety Pyramid - Who's Allowed to Touch",
  "videoUrl": "https://youtu.be/4KiaE9KPu1g",
  "muxPlaybackId": "MPYRvK9KnXqBafit01UdxV023S011gYphUUavHkJKu96Z8",  // ✅ Should exist
  "youtubeVideoId": "4KiaE9KPu1g"
}
```

## Changes Made (Ready for Deployment)

### 1. Backend Data Updated
**File:** `ev-transition-coach-backend/routes/courses.js`
- ✅ Added muxPlaybackId fields to all 18 videos across 5 courses
- ✅ Updated API response processing to explicitly preserve muxPlaybackId

### 2. Git Status
- ✅ All changes committed to main branch (commit f7c596d)
- ✅ Multiple deployment attempts with version bumps
- ✅ Local testing confirms data structure is correct

### 3. Local Verification
```javascript
// Local test confirms muxPlaybackId exists:
{
  "id": "1-1",
  "muxPlaybackId": "MPYRvK9KnXqBafit01UdxV023S011gYphUUavHkJKu96Z8",
  "title": "1.1 EV Safety Pyramid - Who's Allowed to Touch"
}
```

## Troubleshooting Attempts
1. **Multiple git pushes** - No effect
2. **Version bump** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) - No effect
3. **Comment changes** to trigger rebuilds - No effect
4. **Explicit field preservation** in processing - No effect

## Potential Issues
1. **Railway deployment config** - May not be monitoring correct branch/path
2. **CDN/caching layers** - Multiple levels of caching
3. **Build process** - Railway may not be rebuilding properly
4. **Environment variables** - Different environment may be deployed

## Railway Commands to Check
```bash
railway status
railway logs
railway deploy  # Manual trigger
```

## Android Impact
- **Good news**: Android thumbnail fix works independently of muxPlaybackId
- **Video playback**: Will continue using YouTube URLs until mux deployment succeeds
- **All other functionality**: Works correctly with current API response

## Action Required
Please investigate Railway deployment status and ensure the latest main branch changes are deployed to production.

The muxPlaybackId fields are critical for proper Mux video streaming in both iOS and Android apps.
